Light pivot table for MDX2JSON source
====================

This is a lightweight and simple pivot table realization for [MDX2JSON](https://github.com/intersystems-ru/Cache-MDX2JSON) source.

The project is under development right now.

## Installation

There is no way to install this simply right now. First, you need to install and configure
[MDX2JSON](https://github.com/intersystems-ru/Cache-MDX2JSON). Then take a look for
<code>demos/index.html</code> file code. By replacing there URL's and MDX queries you can make this
work for you.

Also you may have a cross-origin (domain) issues when testing. In future, this project will become
a part of DeepSee.
